This is the Debian GNU/Linux r-cran-lme4 package of lme4, a GNU R
package of classes and methods for fitting and examining linear mixed
effects models (also called multilevel models, panel data models, and
several other names) and generalized linear mixed models.

This package was created by Douglas Bates <bates@stat.wisc.edu>. It is
now being maintained by Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>.

The sources were downloaded from 
	http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/contrib/

The package was renamed from its upstream name 'lme4' to 'r-cran-lme4'
